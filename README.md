## Usage

1. Setting up the database:

Using the default database so no setup is needed
2. Running migrations:

Apply database schema changes from your app's models to the actual database:

Bash\
`python manage.py makemigrations`\
`python manage.py migrate`

3. Starting the development server:

Launch the Django development server:

Bash\
`python manage.py runserver`

This will start the server, typically at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

4. Administrative interface:

Access the Django admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/.

You'll need to create a superuser account first using:

Bash\
`python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Testing

The application should have unit and integration tests written in the tests.py file of your app directory. To run them, use:

Bash\
`python manage.py test`
